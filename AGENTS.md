# AGENTS Instructions

When testing any workflow that triggers a Streamerbot `doAction` client call, simulate the client call by running the corresponding C# action code in this repository with the same arguments sent by the client call.

Assume each Streamerbot action consists only of the C# code in this repository, and that the action code executes immediately once Streamerbot receives the `doAction` request.
